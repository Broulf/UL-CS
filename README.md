- Each team member will have an equal vote.
- To pass a change, it must receive a 2/3rds majority vote from the team members present at the meeting.

- Once a team change is approved by the team members through the Majority Rule 2/3rds vote, the decision will be communicated to the Esports Executive Board.

## 8.4 Transparency and Documentation
- All discussions, decisions, and votes regarding team changes should be transparent and documented for future reference.
- Meeting minutes or records of these decisions should be maintained for accountability and transparency purposes.

By following this team change protocol, we ensure that every team member has a say in important decisions and that changes are made with the best interests of the team in mind.

Remember, as a team member, you represent our team/school both in and out of the game. Uphold the team/school's values and maintain a positive and competitive spirit. Failure to abide by these rules may result in disciplinary action, including removal from the team.
